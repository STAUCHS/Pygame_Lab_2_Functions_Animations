## Step #2 - Draw an Object using a Function
- Copy and paste your Pygame Lab #1 into the new assignment
- Put your drawings into a function (e.g. If you drew a house, create a function draw_house) **YOU MUST HAVE *TWO* DRAWINGS IN FUNCTIONS!**
- Both functions must:
  - Include parameters that allows you to draw the object at various locations
- The other function must:
  - Include an additional parameter that allows you to modify the colour when you call the function
- Call your functions to draw them in various locations in your Main Program Loop (e.g. call your draw_house() function three times at three different locations)

## Step #3 - Create an Animation
- Animate one of your objects **using its function** (e.g. draw_cloud() function moving left to right)
- Incorporate basic edge collision detection such that your animated object does not permanently move off the screen.
